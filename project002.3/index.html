        "I love rabbits," &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; you're supposed to say <br>
        around a bonfire &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; when wind blows smoke <br>
        in your face. &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; Admit it–you love rabbits– <br>
        and the air, &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; previously unaware <br>
        of your existence, &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; relents and lets rise <br>
        the kind sting, &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; absorbing, acidic <br>
        to the slightly alkaline &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; gaze of your eyes. <br>
        The wind that &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; retreats will return <br>
        and things could get &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; crazy: that's when <br>
        you repeat it, &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; over and over until <br>
        the great breath &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; defers to this <br>
        old trick. A good &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; fire, we say, <br>
        and skies start &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; to rain water's quiet. <br>
        It blossoms hazy, &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; the smoke hit with what <br>
        should feel like &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; grace, and the wood <br>
        yelps a little, &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; burns all the more <br>
        when heaven's &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; heel tries to put it out. <br>
        Come back and &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; go away again. <br>
        I love rabbits, I love rabbits, I love rabbits.
