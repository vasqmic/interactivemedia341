    <p>
        "I love rabbits," you're supposed to say <br>
        around a <strong>bonfire</strong> when wind blows <strong>smoke</strong> <br>
        in your face. Admit it–you love rabbits– <br>
        and the air, previously unaware <br>
        of your existence, relents and lets rise <br>
        the kind sting, absorbing, acidic <br>
        to the slightly alkaline gaze of your eyes. <br>
        The wind that retreats will return <br>
        and things could get crazy: that's when <br>
        you repeat it, over and over until <br>
        the great breath defers to this <br>
        old trick. A good <strong>fire,</strong> we say, <br>
        and skies start to rain water's quiet. <br>
        It blossoms hazy, the <strong>smoke</strong> hit with what <br>
        should feel like grace, and the <strong>wood</strong> <br>
        yelps a little, <strong>burns</strong> all the more <br>
        when heaven's heel tries to put it out. <br>
        Come back and go away again. <br>
        I love rabbits, I love rabbits, I love rabbits.
