    <p>
        "I love rabbits," you're supposed to say around a bonfire when wind blows smoke in your face. <br>
        Admit it–you love rabbits–and the air, previously unaware of your existence, relents and lets rise the kind sting, absorbing, acidic to the slightly alkaline gaze of your eyes. <br>
        The wind that retreats will return and things could get crazy: that's when you repeat it, over and over until the great breath defers to this old trick. <br>
        A good fire, we say, and skies start to rain water's quiet. <br>
        It blossoms hazy, the smoke hit with what should feel like grace, and the wood yelps a little, burns all the more when heaven's heel tries to put it out. <br>
        <br>
        Come back and go away again. <br>
        <br>
        I love rabbits, I love rabbits, I love rabbits.
