            "I love rabbits," you're supposed to say <br>
            <br>
            around a bonfire when wind blows smoke <br>
            <br>
            in your face. Admit it–you love rabbits– <br>
            <br>
            and the air, previously unaware <br>
            <br>
            of your existence, relents and lets rise <br>
            <br>
            the kind sting, absorbing, acidic <br>
            <br>
            to the slightly alkaline gaze of your eyes. <br>
            <br>
            The wind that retreats will return <br>
            <br>
            and things could get crazy: that's when <br>
            <br>
            you repeat it, over and over until <br>
            <br>
            the great breath defers to this <br>
            <br>
            old trick. A good fire, we say, <br>
            <br>
            and skies start to rain water's quiet. <br>
            <br>
            It blossoms hazy, the smoke hit with what <br>
            <br>
            should feel like grace, and the wood <br>
            <br>
            yelps a little, burns all the more <br>
            <br>
            when heaven's heel tries to put it out. <br>
            <br>
            Come back and go away again. <br>
            <br>
            I love rabbits, I love rabbits, I love rabbits.
