    <p>
        "I love <em>rabbits</em>," you're supposed to say <br>
        around a bonfire when wind blows smoke <br>
        in your face. Admit it–you love <em>rabbits</em>– <br>
        and the air, previously unaware <br>
        of your existence, relents and lets rise <br>
        the kind sting, absorbing, acidic <br>
        to the slightly alkaline gaze of your eyes. <br>
        The wind that retreats will return <br>
        and things could get crazy: that's when <br>
        you repeat it, over and over until <br>
        the great breath defers to this <br>
        old trick. A good fire, we say, <br>
        and skies start to rain water's quiet. <br>
        It blossoms hazy, the smoke hit with what <br>
        should feel like grace, and the wood <br>
        yelps a little, burns all the more <br>
        when heaven's heel tries to put it out. <br>
        Come back and go away again. <br>
        I love <em>rabbits</em>, I love <em>rabbits</em>, I love <em>rabbits</em>.
